There should be a Java applet here. Please check you've got a recent version of
Java installed and switched on.
</applet>
</center>

<p>This applet requires Java version 1.3 or later. You can download version
1.5 for free from <a href="http://www.java.com">www.java.com</a>. If anybody
finds the applet works on an older version let me know. </p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Click in the applet to make sure it has the focus, then use the arrow keys
to move the man around. If you ever owned a BBC micro you will know the rules,
otherwise you have the fun of working them out. Hint: collect all the diamonds.
If you get stuck, reload the page to start again. There's only one level and it
<em>is</em> possible, but it gets increasingly difficult towards the end. Have
fun!</p>

<h2>What is Nifki?</h2>

<p>Nifki is a wiki that allows you to write games like this. You can edit the
source code and the instructions over the web, then click on a button to get a
Java applet or Macromedia flash version of your game. This game is under 300
lines long.</p>

<p>Nifki is not quite finished, but the compiler is <em>nearly</em> there and
as the above game demonstrates the virtual machine works just fine. We're
starting on the wiki part quite soon. After that, we have no idea what will
happen. It's going to be interesting!</p>

<p>"We" are mainly Alistair Turnbull and Tom Lynn. Francis Irving is joining us
for the web part.</p>
