Nifki values are Javascript objects with a "type" field of type String and a
"value" field whose type depends on the type. It is the equivalent of the Java
type "org.sc3d.apt.crazon.vm.state.Value". The allowed values for the "type"
field are exactly as returned by "describeType()" in the Java version, e.g.
"number", "string".

TODO: Write constructor functions for each type and use them everywhere. Take the opportunity to check invariants.
