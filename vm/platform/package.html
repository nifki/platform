 <body>
  <p>
   This package implements AbstractPlatform on top of the java.awt API. It
   provides simple graphics and keyboard and mouse handling to the game engine
   while hiding all the gory details of the underlying API.
  </p>
  <p>
   This package depends on the 'state' package, and so it is possible to pass
   Crazon objects, in the form of Values, to and from this package, and to
   inspect them in this class, without any extra marshalling code.
